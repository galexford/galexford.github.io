### Dream Stealing


**Challenge Description:** 


>I've managed to steal some secrets from their subconscious, can you figure out anything from this?

So, in this challenge, I'm given an MD5 hash, ciphertext that needs to be decrypted, a factor of N, a public key, and a modulus. I think that once I find a supposed flag, I run an MD5 hash on it and check if it matches the MD5 hash I was originally given to determine if it was correct or not. From my understanding, this challenge requires me to essentially apply the hash function backwards to the ciphertext. When I run "ciphertext%public_key", I get 47292.


### Shared Dreaming


**Challenge Description:** 


>It's not just about depth you know, you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it to grow naturally in a subject's mind; it's a very subtle art.

So, in this challenge, I'm given an MD5 hash, ciphertext (with the operations used to obtain it), 3 hints giving more operations used in this cipher, and the length of the flag through RandByte. So, if I can xor the ciphertext with a3 and RandByte, I can get the flag. To do this, 
I first need to get a3. Looking at the hints, I see that xor-ing Hint 2 and Hint 1 would give me a1. If I xor Hint 3 with a1, I can get a3.


So, xor-ing Hint 1 with Hint 2 gives me:
a1 = 6012799428683443997689587680337673480971720162848260648052236293921950878883876866182340141784603077585618289040815411545017412217024358641774352396510770 (in decimal form). a3 = 12969117837359611590158531524137144983698950013035435361651744234441525282625193054901967784556715455348067253045411962885728614821895623458135072145344009.


Now, I need to figure out what RandByte is.

### Totem


**Challenge Description:** 


>Is this a dream or not? Use your totem to find out. Flag format: ctf{}.

When I run the netcat command: "nc chal.ctf.b01lers.com 2008", a response looking like the picture below appears, allowing for an input given by the user. totem-template.py indicates that I need to implement the decryption of various ciphers given by a function name. Namely, the Baconian, rot13, atbash, and base64 decoding. I implemented the cipher decryption for each, and when I run the program, I receive an EOF error at the moment (for rot13). There may be an issue with my implementation.
